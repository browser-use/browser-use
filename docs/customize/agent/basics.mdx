```python
from browser_use import Agent, ChatOpenAI

agent = Agent(
    task="Search for latest news about AI",
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
)

async def main():
    history = await agent.run(max_steps=100)
```

- `task`: The task you want to automate.
- `llm`: Your favorite LLM. See <a href="/customize/supported-models">Supported Models</a>.


The agent is executed using the async `run()` method:

- `max_steps` (default: `100`): Maximum number of steps an agent can take
- `close_after_run` (default: `True`): Whether to close the browser after the agent completes
- `on_step_start`: Hook function called at the beginning of each step
- `on_step_end`: Hook function called at the end of each step
