"""
Example: Custom Interactive Selectors

This example demonstrates how to use custom_interactive_selectors to force
certain elements to be marked as interactive, even if they wouldn't normally
be detected as clickable by the browser-use agent.

This is useful for:
- Custom UI components that don't use standard interactive tags
- Elements with non-standard click handlers
- Complex web applications with custom interaction patterns
