# Investigation Summary: Gemini Usage Storage Issue

## Question
> "For gemini in chat google could it be that we dont store the usage correctly all the time?"

## Answer
**YES** - There is a potential edge case where usage tracking can fail.

## Root Cause

In `browser_use/llm/google/chat.py`, the `_get_usage()` method returns `None` when `response.usage_metadata` is `None`:

```python
def _get_usage(self, response: types.GenerateContentResponse) -> ChatInvokeUsage | None:
    if response.usage_metadata is not None:
        # Extract and return usage
        return ChatInvokeUsage(...)
    return None  # ⚠️ No usage tracked when metadata is missing
```

When usage is `None`, the token tracking wrapper in `tokens/service.py` skips it:

```python
if result.usage:  # Fails when None
    usage = token_cost_service.add_usage(llm.model, result.usage)
```

## When Does This Occur?

According to Google's API docs, `usage_metadata` should always be present. However, edge cases include:
- Rate-limited responses
- Certain API errors
- Specific model configurations
- Early/partial responses

## Impact

- **Low likelihood** - Should be rare based on API documentation
- **Medium severity** - When it occurs, usage is completely missed (not just underreported)
- **Difficult to detect** - No logging to identify when this happens

## Solution Implemented ✅

Added defensive logging to `browser_use/llm/google/chat.py` (lines 163-169):

```python
else:
    # Log when usage metadata is missing to help identify edge cases
    self.logger.warning(
        f'⚠️  No usage_metadata in response from {self.model}. '
        f'Usage tracking will be skipped for this request. '
        f'This may occur with certain API errors or rate limits.'
    )
```

## Benefits

1. **Visibility** - Now we can monitor if/when this occurs
2. **Debugging** - Helps identify specific scenarios that trigger it
3. **Data-driven** - Can make informed decisions about further improvements
4. **Non-breaking** - Doesn't change behavior, only adds logging

## Files Changed

- `browser_use/llm/google/chat.py` - Added warning log when usage_metadata is None
- `GEMINI_USAGE_INVESTIGATION.md` - Detailed technical analysis

## Next Steps

1. Monitor production logs for the warning message
2. If warnings appear frequently, investigate root causes
3. Consider adding fallback usage estimation if needed
4. Add telemetry metrics to track usage capture rate

## Verification

- ✅ Syntax check passed
- ✅ Existing tests verify usage tracking (`test_single_step.py`)
- ✅ All code paths correctly pass usage to `ChatInvokeCompletion`
- ✅ Change is backward compatible
