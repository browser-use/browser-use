# Browser Use: AI-Powered Browser Automation

## Purpose and Overview

**Browser Use** is a Python library that enables AI agents to control a web browser, allowing for the automation of complex web-based tasks.  It bridges the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and browser interaction, making it easy to build agents that can perform actions like filling forms, navigating websites, extracting data, and more, all driven by natural language instructions.  Think of it as a way to give your AI agent the ability to "see" and interact with the web just like a human user.

The core idea is to represent the browser's state (the Document Object Model or DOM) in a way that's easily consumable by LLMs, and then translate the LLM's actions back into browser commands.  This allows the agent to reason about the web page and decide on the best course of action to achieve its goal.

## Quick Start

This section provides a quick guide to installing and using the core features of Browser Use.

### Installation

1.  **Install the `browser-use` package:**

    ```bash
    pip install browser-use
    ```

2.  **Install Playwright's browser dependencies:**

    ```bash
    playwright install
    ```
    This command downloads the necessary browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) that Playwright uses for automation.

### Basic Usage

The following example demonstrates how to create a simple agent that compares the prices of two language models.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from browser_use import Agent
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()  # Load environment variables from a .env file

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Compare the price of gpt-4o and DeepSeek-V3",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),  # Specify the LLM to use
    )
    await agent.run()  # Execute the agent's task

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Explanation:**

*   `load_dotenv()`: This loads environment variables from a `.env` file in your project's root directory.  This is where you'll store your API keys.
*   `Agent(task=..., llm=...)`: Creates an `Agent` instance.
    *   `task`:  The natural language instruction for the agent.
    *   `llm`: The LLM instance that will power the agent.  Here, we're using `ChatOpenAI` from `langchain_openai`, which requires an OpenAI API key.
*   `await agent.run()`: Starts the agent's execution loop.  The agent will interact with the browser to complete the specified task.

### API Key Configuration

You need to provide an API key for the LLM provider you choose.  Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory and add your API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Configuration Options

The `Agent` class likely accepts various configuration options to customize its behavior.  The provided README doesn't go into great detail, but here's a summary based on common patterns and the example code:

*   **`llm` (required):**  The LLM instance to use. This is crucial for the agent's reasoning and decision-making. The example uses `ChatOpenAI`, but other LLMs from LangChain or other libraries could potentially be used.
*   **`task` (required):** The natural language instruction describing the agent's goal.
*   **Other potential options (not explicitly mentioned but likely exist):**
    *   **Browser choice:**  Specifying which browser (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) to use.
    *   **Headless mode:**  Running the browser in the background without a visible window.
    *   **Timeout settings:**  Controlling how long the agent waits for actions to complete.
    *   **Debugging options:**  Enabling verbose logging or stepping through the agent's actions.
    * **Custom functions:** The README mentions a "save_to_file_hugging_face.py" example, suggesting the ability to define custom actions for the agent.

Refer to the official documentation ([https://docs.browser-use.com](https://docs.browser-use.com)) for a comprehensive list of configuration options.

## Package Summary & Installation (Single Package)

The project appears to consist of a single primary Python package: `browser-use`.

*   **Package Name:** `browser-use`
*   **Installation:** `pip install browser-use`
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   `playwright`: For browser automation.
    *   `langchain_openai`:  For interacting with OpenAI models (if using `ChatOpenAI`).
    *   `python-dotenv`: For loading environment variables.
    *   `gradio` (optional, for the UI demo): For creating web-based user interfaces.
*   **Purpose:** Provides the core functionality for creating and running browser-controlling AI agents.

## Public APIs/Interfaces

The primary public API is the `Agent` class.  Its key methods are:

*   **`Agent(task: str, llm: object, ...)` (Constructor):** Initializes a new agent instance.
*   **`async run()`:** Starts the agent's execution loop, causing it to interact with the browser to complete its task.

The exact details of other public APIs and interfaces are not fully described in the provided README.  Consult the full documentation for a complete API reference.

## Dependencies and Requirements

*   **Python:** Version 3.11 or higher.
*   **Playwright:**  `playwright` (install with `pip install playwright`, then run `playwright install`).
*   **LangChain (likely):** Although not strictly required, the examples heavily utilize LangChain for LLM integration.  Specifically, `langchain_openai` is used in the quick start.
*   **OpenAI API Key:** Required if using `ChatOpenAI`.
*   **`python-dotenv`:**  For managing environment variables.
* **`gradio`** (optional): Needed for running the Gradio UI demo.

## Advanced Usage Examples

The README provides links to several examples in the `examples` directory (which is not included in the packed representation).  These examples showcase more advanced use cases:

*   **`examples/use-cases/shopping.py`:**  Adds grocery items to a cart and checks out.  This demonstrates e-commerce automation.
*   **`examples/use-cases/find_and_apply_to_jobs.py`:**  Reads a CV, finds relevant jobs, saves them to a file, and starts applying.  This shows how to automate job searching and application processes.
*   **`examples/browser/real_browser.py`:**  Writes a letter in Google Docs and saves it as a PDF.  This illustrates interaction with web-based applications.
*   **`examples/custom-functions/save_to_file_hugging_face.py`:**  Searches for models on Hugging Face based on specific criteria and saves the results to a file. This highlights the ability to extend the agent with custom functions.
* **Gradio UI demo:** The README mentions a Gradio-based UI demo, suggesting interactive control and visualization of the agent.

These examples demonstrate the versatility of Browser Use for various tasks, from simple data extraction to complex workflows involving multiple websites and applications.
