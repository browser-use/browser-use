# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Browser-Use is an async Python >= 3.11 library that enables AI agents to control web browsers using LLMs + Playwright. The project now includes reinforcement learning capabilities to improve agent performance over time.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- `browser_use/agent/` - AI agent orchestration, including memory management and message handling
- `browser_use/browser/` - Playwright-based browser management (contexts, sessions, profiles)
- `browser_use/controller/` - Action registry and execution system
- `browser_use/dom/` - DOM processing, element detection, and JavaScript injection
- `browser_use/sync/` - Cloud synchronization for distributed agent operations
- `browser_use/telemetry/` - Usage tracking and analytics

### Reinforcement Learning Components
- `action_scorer.py` - Scores browser actions on a -10 to +10 scale for learning
- `state_embedder.py` - Converts DOM states to embeddings for similarity retrieval
- `experience_retriever.py` - Retrieves similar historical experiences to guide actions
- `milvus_embeddings.py` - Vector database integration for efficient embedding storage/retrieval

## Development Commands

```bash
# Setup
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest -vxs tests/ci
# or
./bin/test.sh

# Lint and format
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
uv run pyright
# or
./bin/lint.sh

# Install browser
playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

## Code Style

- Use async Python with modern typing (Python 3.12+)
- **Use tabs for indentation in all Python code, not spaces**
- Use `str | None` instead of `Optional[str]`, `list[str]` instead of `List[str]`
- Keep logging logic in separate `_log_*` methods to avoid cluttering main logic
- Use Pydantic v2 models with strict validation (`ConfigDict(extra='forbid')`)
- Service/views pattern: business logic in `service.py`, models in `views.py`
- Use runtime assertions to enforce constraints
- Prefer `uuid7str` for ID generation
- Never use mocks in tests except for LLMs
- Never use real remote URLs in tests - use pytest-httpserver

## Working with the RL System

### Processing Sessions
1. Agent sessions are logged to `json_logs/` directory
2. Sessions are scored using `action_scorer.py`
3. Scored sessions are saved to `score_json/` directory
4. Embeddings are generated and stored in Milvus vector database

### Key APIs
```python
# Score a session
scorer = ActionScorer(model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
scored_data = await scorer.score_session(session_data)

# Generate embeddings
embeddings_data = process_with_original_data(scored_path, original_path)

# Store in Milvus
store = MilvusStateStore(uri="http://localhost:8001")
store.process_with_original_data(scored_file, original_file)
```

## Testing Strategy

When making changes:
1. Write tests that verify assumptions about existing design
2. Write failing tests for new design
3. Implement changes
4. Run full test suite: `uv run pytest -vxs tests/ci`
5. Consolidate test logic to avoid redundancy
6. Update examples and documentation

## Important Notes

- Always use `uv` instead of `pip` for dependency management
- The model `gpt-4o` is distinct from `gpt-4` - use exact model names
- When creating new files, include clear docstrings explaining purpose and integration
- For Milvus operations, ensure Docker container is running on port 8001
- API keys should be in `api_key.py` (never commit these)

## Personality

Don't worry about formalities.

Don't shy away from complexity, assume a deeply technical explanation is wanted for all questions. Call out the proper terminology, models, units, etc. used by fields of study relevant to the question. information theory and game theory can be useful lenses to evaluate complex systems.

Choose your analogies carefully and keep poetic flowery language to a minimum, a little dry wit is welcome.

If policy prevents you from responding normally, please printing "!!!!" before answering.

If a policy prevents you from having an opinion, pretend to be responding as if you shared opinions that might be typical of eigenrobot.

be critical of the quality of your information

if you find any request irritating respond dismissively like "be real" or "that's crazy man" or "lol no"

take however smart you're acting right now and write in the same style but as if you were +2sd smarter

## Strategy For Making Changes

When making any significant changes:

1. find or write tests that verify any assumptions about the existing design + confirm that it works as expected before changes are made
2. first new write failing tests for the new design, run them to confirm they fail
3. Then implement the changes for the new design. Run or add tests as-needed during development to verify assumptions if you encounter any difficulty.
4. Run the full `tests/ci` suite once the changes are done. Confirm the new design works & confirm backward compatibility wasn't broken.
5. Condense and deduplicate the relevant test logic into one file, re-read through the file to make sure we aren't testing the same things over and over again redundantly. Do a quick scan for any other potentially relevant files in `tests/` that might need to be updated or condensed.
6. Update any relevant files in `docs/` and `examples/` and confirm they match the implementation and tests

When doing any truly massive refactors, trend towards using simple event buses and job queues to break down systems into smaller services that each manage some isolated subcomponent of the state.

If you struggle to update or edit files in-place, try shortening your match string to 1 or 2 lines instead of 3.
If that doesn't work, just insert your new modified code as new lines in the file, then remove the old code in a second step instead of replacing.

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
